# 🏆 Daily Coding Challenges

Welcome to my **Daily Coding Challenges** repository!  
Here, I document my journey solving coding challenges every day using **JavaScript**.  
The goal: stay consistent, sharpen problem-solving skills, and write clean, efficient code.

- **Day-XX/** – Each folder contains that day's challenge solution  
- **solution.js** – JavaScript solution file (can include multiple approaches)  
- * `README.md` inside each folder to describe the problem & solution if needed  

---

## 🏁 Goals

- **Consistency** – Commit at least one challenge per day  
- **Code Quality** – Write clean, maintainable JavaScript  
- **Learning** – Practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving patterns  
- **Tracking** – Document progress and learnings along the way  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** JavaScript (Node.js runtime)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Editor:** VS Code  

---

## 🚀 Run Solutions

Each solution can be executed with Node.js:

```bash
node Day-01/solution.js
```

*(Replace `Day-01` with the folder you want to run.)*

## 💡 Future Plans

- Add automated tests with **Jest**  
- Solve the same challenge with multiple approaches
